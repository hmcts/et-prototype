    <form action="7-judgment-R92" method="post">
    <p class="govuk-body">Use this form to have a judgment made by a tribunal reconsidered. This may be a judgment made by a judge alone or by a judge sitting with non-legal members.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If reconsideration is necessary in the interests of justice you can ask the tribunal to look at the judgment again.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Only a judgment which finally determines an issue in your case can be reconsidered. This therefore excludes any decision that does not comprise a final determination of the claim, or part of a claim. If you wish to ask for a case management order to be varied or revoked, use the vary or revoke an order application.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You can only ask the tribunal to reconsider a judgment within 14 days of the date the judgment was sent to you.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you want the tribunal to reconsider a judgment that was sent to you over 14 days ago you must explain why your application is late.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">A reconsideration application does not affect the time limit for appealing to the Employment Appeal Tribunal.</p>

        <li>the judgment you want reconsidered</li>
        <li>the date the tribunal issued the judgment</li>

        <li>why it is in the interests of justice to reconsider this judgment</li>
        <li>if the tribunal should vary or revoke the judgment</li>
        <li>any additional information or material which the tribunal does not already have to support your application</li>
